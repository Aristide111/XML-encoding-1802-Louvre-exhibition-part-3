# The Louvre Exhibition Project: Second Part

During the Second French War against Italy, which took place between 1799 and 1801, the French army seized numerous Italian works of art. In 1802, the Louvre Museum organized an art exhibition showcasing the most significant pieces acquired during this campaign. The exhibition quickly gained widespread popularity and provoked a variety of reactions in the contemporary press. Many of these press reviews are now archived at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF). 

For this phase of our project, we have developed an ODD to refine the TEI structure of our second assignment and improve the precision of our encoding. This time, we focused on tracking works of art by encoding their type and artist name.

## AI Usage:

This time, we used AI to correct our ODD because the initial version, generated from the XML file of assignment 2, contained errors. The `<s>` tags was not recognized. 
We added comments in the ODD to indicate where AI was used for debugging.

We believe the error originated from our misunderstanding of Oxygen’s parameters for generating an ODD from XML.
