# Reflection Note

This course has significantly increased my understanding of TEI and improved my text encoding skills. To be honest, my first assignment was largely unsuccessful; at the time, I hadn't yet grasped the full potential and flexibility of encoding, and my work reflected only a minimal engagement with its possibilities.

By the second assignment, I have realized the power of TEI, particularly regarding dictionary structures and the ability to extract massive amounts of data. I also discovered the TEI community, which proved invaluable. Finding good documentation online beyond the official Guidelines can be difficult, so their support was essential.

During the third assignment, I found it fascinating to see how flexible TEI can be, and it was interesting to contribute a little bit by creating a new ODD. However, I feel I still need more time to fully understand the technical particularities of ODDs and their relationship with schemas and RelaxNG files.

In conclusion, I now truly understand the potential of encoding, especially when the data is integrated with analysis or visualization tools. Using methods like structured dictionaries, the possibilities seem almost limitless. 
For Example, in a project like the "Louvre Exhibition," we could generate maps from location data, build databases of artists and artworks, and even track the historical movement of art. This approach is incredibly valuable for historical research and patrimonial preservation.
